## üîí Strict and Deprecation Rules

This package is designed to work seamlessly with [phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules) and [phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules). These packages provide extra strict and deprecation-related rules for PHPStan, helping you enforce best practices and avoid deprecated code usage.

To enable these rules, make sure you have both packages installed (they are included in the dependencies) and add them to your `phpstan.neon` configuration:

```yaml
includes:
    - vendor/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules/rules.neon
    - vendor/phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules/rules.neon
    - vendor/pekral/phpstan-rules/extension.neon
```

You can then configure strict rules in the `parameters > strictRules` section of your `phpstan.neon` file. For a full list of available strict rules, see the [phpstan-strict-rules documentation](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules#rules).
