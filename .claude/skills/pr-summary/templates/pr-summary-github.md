{assignment_verdict}

**Authors:** [@github-handle-1, @github-handle-2 — or `Name <email>` when no GitHub handle is known, comma-separated in commit order; never the agent / CR identity]
**Available behind:** [optional — present only when the change is reachable only behind a test parameter; name the toggle (e.g. `config('feature.new_pricing')`, ENV `BETA_PRICING=1`, query `?preview=1`, admin switch *New pricing preview*) and the value required to reach it; omit this line entirely when the change is reachable unconditionally]

## Summary of changes

**[Short headline naming the change — one line]**

[One paragraph (3–5 sentences) in plain language explaining the business reason, the affected area, and just enough technical context (integration, payload, table, endpoint, …) that a developer can locate the change without reading the diff. Phrase impersonally — "The change …", "This update …" — never first person.]

## How to test

1. [If *Available behind* is set, this step **must** enable the toggle / supply the parameter / switch the admin flag — naming the exact value]
2. [Next action a tester performs]
3. [Outcome the tester verifies]

{embedded_blocks}

> Render the `{embedded_blocks}` slot only when the calling CR wrapper passes one or more markdown blocks (typically the `## Assignment Compliance` block returned by `@skills/assignment-compliance-check/SKILL.md`). Each block is appended verbatim, in the order received, separated by a single blank line. When no blocks are passed, omit this slot entirely — including the surrounding blank lines — so the comment ends right after `How to test`.

> Render the `{assignment_verdict}` slot at the very top **whenever the calling CR wrapper passes an `## Assignment Compliance` block** (i.e. a tracker is linked). It is a single bold line in the assignment language stating the `Goal met` outcome and pointing the reader to the detail below — on a gap run: non-compliance and the gap count `N` (taken from the block's `Goal met: No` verdict / count of Not met, Partial, and Divergent entries) — e.g. `⚠️ **Changes do not satisfy the assignment — N gap(s). See Assignment Compliance below.**` (Czech assignment → `⚠️ **Změny nesplňují zadání — N nedostatk(ů). Viz Assignment Compliance níže.**`); on a clean run: the fully affirmative report naming the total acceptance-criteria count `N` (taken from the block's `Goal met: Yes` verdict) — e.g. `✅ **Changes satisfy the assignment — all N acceptance criteria met. See Assignment Compliance below.**` (Czech assignment → `✅ **Změny splňují zadání — všech N acceptance criteria splněno. Viz Assignment Compliance níže.**`). When no tracker is linked (no Assignment Compliance block passed), omit this slot entirely — including the surrounding blank line — so the comment begins at `Authors`. Rendering the positive line on a clean run is the deliberate, narrow **affirmative exception** to the report-only-what-needs-action convention (`@rules/code-review/general.mdc` *Two-part CR output — Technical & Functional review*), scoped to this banner alone.
