# Code Review

> **Technical review.** This comment is the **Technical review** half of the two-part CR output (`@rules/code-review/general.mdc` *Two-part CR output — Technical & Functional review*) — strict rule compliance only. The **Functional review** (full acceptance-criteria checklist, `Goal met: Yes/No`) is published separately on the linked-tracker comment via `@skills/pr-summary/SKILL.md`; its one-line verdict mirrors onto this comment's `Summary` line as `assignment conformance: …`.

> **Section visibility — render only sections that have content.** Always render the header block (Status / Counts / Last updated) and the final `Summary` line. The `Coverage:` header line, the `## Coverage` section, and the `coverage …` slot in the summary line are conditional — render them **only** when the coverage gate produced something to report (uncovered changed lines or unavailable / non-runnable tooling, both Critical findings per `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md` Coverage gate). When every changed line is at 100% coverage and the tool ran successfully, drop all three coverage surfaces; the Counts line is the clean signal. The `## Architecture` section follows the same conditional rule (issue #530): on Laravel projects the architecture walk runs on every CR run, but the heading is rendered **only when the walk produces at least one finding** — when the walk is clean, omit the heading entirely (no "walked, 0 findings" line, no "clean" placeholder, no confirmation that the check ran). On non-Laravel projects (`laravel/framework` not in `composer.json` `require`), omit the `## Architecture` section entirely. Every section is conditional: omit its heading and body entirely when it has no items. Never emit `None.` / `Not applicable.` / `n/a` / `100%` / `walked, 0 findings` placeholders for empty sections or omitted coverage surfaces — drop them entirely. The Counts line in the header is the single source of "zero" signal; the goal is a clean, scannable PR comment a human can read at a glance — only items that still need action remain in the body.

**Status:** clean / needs-fix
**Counts:** Critical {n} · Moderate {n} · Minor {n} · Refactoring {n}
**Coverage:** {result} (tool: {name or "not available — <reason>"})  *(render this line only when the `## Coverage` section is rendered — i.e. uncovered changed lines or unavailable tooling)*
**Last updated:** {ISO-8601 timestamp of this CR run}

> **Always-new comment:** the CR wrapper (`code-review-github` / `code-review-jira`) publishes this output as a **new comment on every run** — it never edits a prior comment in place. GitHub comments carry an actor marker (`<!-- cr-comment:actor=<gh-login> -->`); JIRA comments carry no marker. The chronological sequence of comments is the audit trail — never re-create a `Previous CR Status` section in the body.

## Findings

> Render only when at least one Critical, Moderate, or Minor finding exists. Within this section, render only the severity sub-headings that have items — omit the others entirely. When all three severities are empty, omit the entire `## Findings` parent heading.

### 🔴 Critical 1. <short title>

- **Location:** `path/to/file.php:42`
- **Rule:** `@rules/<area>/<file>.mdc#<section>`
- **Impact:** one sentence — what breaks or what risk this introduces.
- **Faulty Example:**
  ```php
  // minimal code or input that reproduces the issue (no secrets / PII)
  ```
- **Expected behavior:** single assertable statement (return value, thrown exception, persisted state, emitted event).
- **Test hint:** test layer (unit / integration / feature) + entry point, in one sentence.
- **Suggested fix:**
  ```php
  // minimal corrected snippet — must comply with @rules/php/core-standards.mdc (and @rules/laravel/architecture.mdc on Laravel projects). Use `n/a — <reason>` only when a snippet adds no value.
  ```

### 🟠 Moderate 1. <short title>

(same six fields as Critical)

### 🟡 Minor 1. <short title>

- **Location:** `path/to/file.php:42`
- **Note:** one sentence. Faulty Example / Expected behavior / Test hint / Suggested fix may be omitted when no behavior change is implied.

## Refactoring (DRY / tech debt)

> Render only when at least one in-scope refactoring item exists. Only items on lines touched by this PR (added or modified). Each item must reduce tech debt — no stylistic preferences. Omit the entire section when there are no items.

1. **Location:** `path/to/file.php:42`
   **Problem:** one sentence.
   **Refactor:** concrete consolidation step (Data Builder / DTO / Service / Action / Repository / ModelManager).
   **Why:** the rule reference the item satisfies (`@rules/laravel/architecture.mdc#<section>`, `@rules/code-review/general.mdc#<section>`, …); for a lens-produced item, also the matched `@skills/class-refactoring/SKILL.md` guideline.

---

## Refactoring proposals

> Render only when at least one out-of-scope structural improvement is justified by a rule. Omit the entire section when there are no items.

1. **Title:** short, actionable issue title
   **Scope:** affected file(s) or area
   **Reason:** rule violated + why it matters
   **Approach:** brief description

---

## Database Analysis

> Render only when the diff touches database operations (raw SQL, Eloquent / query-builder calls, eager loads, model scopes, ModelManager / Repository methods, migrations, seeders, DynamoDB / NoSQL access) **and** at least one finding is produced by `@skills/mysql-problem-solver/SKILL.md`. Omit the entire section when no DB operations are present in the diff, or when DB ops are present but no findings result — never leave a placeholder or fold it into Coverage.
>
> Report only findings (errors) and their fix recommendations. Never include the trigger decision, an inspected `file:line` list, or an EXPLAIN / static-analysis summary — those belong to the internal investigation, not the published review.

- **Findings:**
  1. **{Critical / Moderate / Minor}** — `file:line` — one-sentence problem
     **Suggested Fix:** {query rewrite to reuse an existing index per `@rules/sql/optimalize.mdc`, batch operation per "Batch over per-row operations", or new-index proposal justified by EXPLAIN when no existing index covers the query}

---

## Architecture

> **Laravel-only, conditional on findings (issue #530).** On every Laravel project (`laravel/framework` is in `composer.json` `require`), the architecture walk per `@skills/code-review/SKILL.md` Core Analysis "Architecture conformance (Laravel) — mandatory standalone walk-through" runs on every CR run, but this section is rendered **only when the walk produces at least one finding**.
>
> - **Walk produced findings →** render the `## Architecture` heading and list the findings below under Critical / Moderate / Minor severity sub-headings (same six reproducer fields as `## Findings`), each citing the offending `file:line` and the specific subsection of `@rules/laravel/architecture.mdc` (`Business Logic Layers`, `Actions`, `Action Rules`, `Model Services`, `Repositories and ModelManagers`, `DTOs`, `Data Modification (DRY)`, `Data Builders`, `Validation Rules (Traits)`, `Data Validators`, `Controllers and Other Entry Points`, `Resource Controllers`, `Single-Action Controllers`, `Livewire`, `Custom Helpers`).
> - **Walk produced zero findings →** omit the entire `## Architecture` heading and body. Do not render a `walked, 0 findings` status line, a `clean` placeholder, or any other confirmation that the check ran. The absence of the section is the clean signal — only items that still need action are reported.
> - **Non-Laravel projects →** omit the entire `## Architecture` section. Do not emit a "skipped" placeholder.

### 🔴 Critical 1. <short title>

(same six fields as `## Findings` — Location / Rule / Impact / Faulty Example / Expected behavior / Test hint / Suggested fix)

### 🟠 Moderate 1. <short title>

(same six fields as Critical)

### 🟡 Minor 1. <short title>

- **Location:** `path/to/file.php:42`
- **Rule:** `@rules/laravel/architecture.mdc#<subsection>`
- **Note:** one sentence. Faulty Example / Expected behavior / Test hint / Suggested fix may be omitted when no behavior change is implied.

---

## Coverage

> Render this section **only** when the coverage gate produced something to report — uncovered changed lines (Critical findings) or unavailable / non-runnable coverage tooling (Critical finding). When every changed line is at 100% coverage and the tool ran successfully, omit the entire `## Coverage` section, the `Coverage:` header line, and the `coverage …` slot in the summary line — the Counts line is the clean signal.

- **Tool:** {project's available coverage tooling used to verify the changed files (Phing coverage target, Composer `test:coverage` / `coverage`, or `vendor/bin/pest --coverage-clover` / PHPUnit `--coverage-clover`) — or "coverage tooling unavailable — <reason>". Assess the changed files only; do not gate on a project-wide coverage percentage.}
- **Command:** `<exact command run — e.g. `vendor/bin/pest --coverage-clover=coverage.xml`>`
- **Result:** {list of uncovered added/changed lines — which must also appear as Critical findings — or "coverage tooling unavailable — <reason>"}

---

**Summary:** {n} Critical · {n} Moderate · {n} Minor · {n} Refactoring · assignment conformance: {conformant | N gap(s) | no linked issue}{` · coverage {result}` — appended only when the `## Coverage` section is rendered; omitted on a clean 100% pass}
